#Dranger

## A config setup for using ranger with drupal, drush and git.


Mostly this is just key commands currently, using the ',' leader al la vim.

This setup is for working with multiple git repos and/or features.
It uses the ranger filesystem for triggering drush feature updates/reverts, git diff, push, checkout etc, 
and heaps more. It gives a pretty fast workflow that's hard to match on a command-line or gui. 
  

Read through rc.conf for details.
