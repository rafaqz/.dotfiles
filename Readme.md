# Dotfiles

This repo is configuration for an linux setup built around
-arch linux
-awesome wm
-urxvt
-bash 
-vim
-ranger fm 
-and general cli and X11 apps that I use.

It's a blazing fast, mouse-free work environment where vim-like key commands are the standard, except in the boring old desktop apps of course...

Wont eat your kittens. Will frighten your housemates.



My vim config maintained separately [here] (https://github.com/rafaqz/vimrc) and is pretty tightly integrated with both awesome and ranger.
