# Dotfiles

This repo is configuration for a linux setup built around
-arch linux
-xmonad
-urxvt
-bash 
-vim
-ranger fm 
-pandoc
-and general cli and X11 apps that I use.

It's a blazing fast, mouse-free work environment where vim-like key commands are standard.

Wont eat your kittens. Will frighten your housemates.



My vim config is maintained separately [here] (https://github.com/rafaqz/vimrc) and is pretty tightly integrated with both awesome and ranger.
